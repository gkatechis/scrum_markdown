# What is Scrum?

## Scrum Team

A small team, with one Product Owner, one Scrum Leader, and a group of Developers. There are no sub-teams or hierarchies. Everyone is working together to focus on the Product Goal.

### Developers

* Creating a plan for the sprint Sprint Backlog
* Adhere to the Definition of Done
* Making daily adjustments toward the Sprint Goal
* Hold each other accountable

### Product Owner

* Develop and communicate the Product Goal
* Create and communicate Product Backlog items
* Order the Product Backlog items
* Ensure that the Product Backlog is clear, available, and understood by the Scrum Team

### Scrum Leader

* Help the Scrum Team self-manage and work cross-functionally
* Help the Scrum Team create quality Increments that meet the Definition of Done
* Remove obstacles from the Scrum Team
* Ensure that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and on time

## Scrum Events

The Sprint is the main "container" for all of the other events listed below. Each of the events are an opportunity to inspect and make changes to the Scrum Artifacts. The events are created to keep a regular cadence to the team's workflow and minimize meetings, usually at the same time/place.

### Sprint

* Fixed length, one month or less, starts immediately after the previous sprint ends
  * This is where the work occurs to hit the Product Goal. This work includes the Spring Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective...they all occur during the sprint.
  * During the sprint:
    * No changes that threaten the Sprint Goal
    * Quality doesn't go down
    * Product Backlog is refined if necessary
    * Scope can be clarified/negotiated with the Product Owner

### Sprint Planning

* Kickoff event for the Sprint, where the work to be completed during the Sprint is laid out and discussed. The plan that comes out of this meeting is a collaborative effort from the whole team, not passed down from "above."
* These topics are discussed:
  
#### Why is this Sprint valuable?

* Product Owner proposes the value, Scrum Team collaborates to define why the Sprint Goal is valuable to stakeholders. Sprint Goal needs to be finalized before the end of the Sprint Planning meeting.
  
#### What can be accomplished this Sprint?

* Working with the Product Owner, the Developers select items from the Product Backlog to add to the new Sprint. The items can be refined during this process so that everyone understands what is being accomplished.
  
* Forecasting occurs while selecting the items. This will get better over time.
  
#### How does the work get done?

* For every item chosen from the Product Backlog, the Developers plan the necessary work to create an Increment that meets the Definition of Done. This is entirely up to the Developers.
* The Sprint Goal, the selected Product Backlog items for the Sprint, plus the plan for delivery of the items is the Sprint Backlog.

### Daily Standup

* The purpose is to see how progress is moving toward the Sprint Goal and then adapt the Sprint Backlog as needed, making changes to the planned work.
* 15 minutes, every day, only Developers need to attend, unless Product Owner or Scrum Leader are actively working items in the Sprint Backlog.
* Developers create the structure and techniques for the meeting, whatever works best to focus on progress to the Sprint Goal and provides an action plan for the next day of work.
* Note: Developers can and should meet throughout the day as needed to adjust the plan

### Sprint Review

* Second to last event in the Sprint. Might seem similar to the Sprint Retrospective, however it is a review of what was done, as opposed to what can be changed as a result of what was learned.
* The purpose is to check on the outcome of the Sprint and then make future changes as needed. The Scrum Team can also present results to any stakeholders, as well as discussion on progress toward the Product Goal.
* Review what was accomplished and what changed during the Sprint. From this, the Scrum Team collaborates on what next steps should be taken. Product Backlog can also be adjusted based on new opportunities.
* This isn't a presentation, it's a review, so there should be discussion.

### Sprint Retrospective

* The purpose is increase quality and effectiveness
* The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went, focusing on individuals, interactive, processes, tools, and the Definition of Done.
* Assumptions that were made are identified and explored.
* Discuss 1) what went well, 2) what problems were encountered, and 3) how the problem were or were not solved.
* Identify the most impactful changes to be addressed ASAP. Potentially even added to the next Sprint's Sprint Backlog.
* Time boxed to 3 hours for a month-long Sprint and for shorter Sprints, less time as appropriate.

## Scrum artifacts

Artifacts are a representation of work or value to the Product Goal. Each artifact provides transparency and focus so that everyone is on the same page with the same vision:

* For the Product Backlog, we have a Product Goal
* For the Sprint Backlog, we have the Sprint Goal
* For the Increment, it is the Definition of Done

### Product Backlog

* This is an adaptable, ordered list of what needs to be done to improve the product. This is the source of all work that the Scrum Team undertakes.
* Items in the Product Backlog that meet the Definition of Done within one Sprint are "ready" and available for a Spring Planning event. This readiness is accomplished through refinement with the Scrum Team. Product Backlog refinement is when the team goes through the Product Backlog and defines them into smaller and more precise items. This is an ongoing activity to add details.
* The Developers doing the work are responsible for the sizing. The Product Owner can help influence the Developers by helping them understand make trade-offs.

#### Commitment for the Product Backlog: Product Goal

* The Product Goal is the long-term objective for the Scrum Team and it is the target to plan against. The Product Backlog will emerge as a result of the definition whether or not it will meet the Product Goal.
  
### Sprint Backlog

* This contains the what, why, and how for the Sprint: Sprint Goal (why we're doing this work), the Product Backlog items that were selected for the Sprint (what we're doing), and a plan for delivering the Increment (how).
* It is a plan by and for the Developers. This is a visible, real-time outline of what the Developers will accomplish during the Sprint, in order to meet the Sprint Goal. As a result, the Sprint Backlog is updated throughout the Sprint as more information comes in.

#### Commitment for the Spring Backlog: Sprint Goal

* The Sprint Goal is the singular objective for the Sprint. While it is a commitment by and for the Developers, it's also flexible in terms of what is needed to accomplish it.
* The Spring Goal is created during Sprint Planning and it is then added to the Sprint Backlog. This is done so that if the work created is different from what was expected, the Developers can collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of the Sprint Backlog with the Sprint, without affecting the Sprint Goal.

### Increment

* This is a concrete stepping stone towards the Product Goal. Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments, and is thoroughly verified to ensure that the Increments all work together. In order to provide value, the Increment has to be usable.
* There can (and likely will) be multiple Increments created during the Sprint. The sum of the Increments is what is presented during the Sprint Review. Work that is part of an Increment must meet the Definition of Done.

#### Commitment for the Increment: Definition of Done

* This is a formal description for the state of the Increment when it meets the quality needed for the product
* When a Product Backlog item meets the Definition of Done, an Increment is born
* This creates transparency to everyone on the Scrum Team (and stakeholders) as to what was done as part of an Increment. If a Product Backlog item doesn't meet the Definition of Done, it is not released or presented during the Sprint Review. It goes back into the Product Backlog for later refinement.
* The Definition of Done should be seen as a minimum for what should be done for an Increment, as appropriate for the product
* The Developers must conform to the Definition of Done
